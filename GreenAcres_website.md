Proposed Website Features

Custom Animation Concepts for Coffee Types

Instead of creating separate pages for each coffee type (Sidama, Yirgacheffe, Guji, Djimmah, Limmu, Lekempti), we propose an interactive animated showcase:

1.  **Interactive Coffee Map:** An animated map of Ethiopia where users can click/hover on regions to see coffee details with smooth transitions

2.  **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** As users scroll, each coffee region animates into view with flavor profiles, altitude, and processing methods

3.  **Coffee Bean Carousel:** 3D rotating coffee beans that transform to reveal different varietals with tasting notes

4.  **Parallax Coffee Journey:** From seedling to cup, showing the complete process with animated illustrations

5.  **Flavor Wheel Animation:** Interactive flavor wheel that expands to show each coffee type's unique characteristics

Responsive Design Strategy

**The website will be fully responsive with special considerations for:**

- **Desktop (1200px+):** Full animations, multi-column layouts, immersive video backgrounds

- **Tablet (768px-1199px):** Adjusted animations, two-column layouts, touch-optimized interactions

- **Mobile (320px-767px):** Simplified animations, single-column layout, swipe gestures

- **Foldable Devices:** Adaptive layouts using CSS Container Queries and the Fold API to optimize content across hinge states

Performance Optimization

For fast loading speeds, we will implement:

- Next.js or Astro framework with static site generation

- Image optimization with WebP/AVIF formats and lazy loading

- CDN delivery for global audience reach

- Code splitting and bundle optimization

- Preloading critical assets

- Service worker for offline capability
